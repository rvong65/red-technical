# Red-Technical
1. This is a machine learning based web application built using Django, React, and the transformers library in Python. To start using the app, the user must create an account in order to be logged in. Once logged in, they can input any sentence or text which will be sent to a text classification model (from the transformers library) in the backend to be classified as either positive or negative. Once the output is generated, it will be sent back to the frontend where it will be displayed including the classification (positive or negative) and the accuracy of the model's prediction. Once the user is done, they can click the sign out area on the top right of the screen. 
2. Features that I chose to include are frontend components, mobile responsiveness, user registration/login/logout functionality, API calls, and linking together a frontend framework (React) with a backend framework (Django).
3. I spent about three days developing this project.
4. The video for this project is below. (**Note:** I recorded this on a widescreen monitor so the content in the video may appear small. I recommend watching the video in full-screen mode.)
